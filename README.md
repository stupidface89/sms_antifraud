## SMS Antifraud System with NLP
This project develops an advanced SMS antifraud system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect and prevent fraudulent SMS messages in real-time. The system integrates SMS Bot ANDROID for interacting with Android devices, SMS ANDROID API Farm for managing SMS traffic, and Apache Kafka for high-throughput messaging.

The core functionality includes real-time analysis of incoming SMS content, sentiment analysis to identify suspicious language patterns, and advanced text processing algorithms for anomaly detection. Machine learning models are trained to classify messages as legitimate or fraudulent, with continuous updates to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

Technological stack consists of Python Flask API for backend operations, PostgreSQL database for data storage, and Redis for caching. NLP components utilize spaCy for text processing, Transformers library for advanced models, and Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms. The system is containerized with Docker and deployed using Kubernetes for scalability, running on AWS infrastructure.

Frontend implementation features React.js for real-time UI updates, Material UI for responsive design, and Redux for state management. Integration with SMS Bot ANDROID enables seamless interaction with Android devices, while SMS ANDROID API Farm facilitates efficient SMS management. Kafka ensures reliable messaging between components, providing fault-tolerant data streaming capabilities.

The system offers API endpoints for SMS analysis and fraud detection reporting, with plans to enhance the platform by integrating advanced deep learning models, developing a real-time analytics dashboard, and expanding multi-language support for broader applicability.
